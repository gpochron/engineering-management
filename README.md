# Engineering Management & Leadership Resources
My favorite software engineering management and leadership resources. This is a work in progress.

## Select Articles
 * [Stables and Volatiles](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/stables-and-volatiles/)) - I've shared this article with colleagues countless times over the years. I think it highlights a scenario that software companies inevitably run into as they grow and mature, and I have found that it does a good job of providing a stance on "the why" some engineers operate the way they do.

## Websites/Blogs
 * [Irrational Exuberance](https://lethain.com/) - Will Larson's blog. Full of a wealth of articles on software engineering leadership & management.
 * [Jade Rubick](https://www.rubick.com/) - Jade Rubick's blog on software engineering leadership & management.
 * [LeadDev](https://leaddev.com/)

## Books
 * [An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/) - One of my favorite resources for engineering managers and leaders. It'll fill your management toolbox with options to navigate the fun of leadership at high-growth companies. What I especially love about this book is that it goes beyond the more basic advice you'll get out of most management books.
 * [The Manager's Path](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-ebook/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/) - This is a fairly comprehensive overview of the lifecycle of becoming an engineering manager. It's a great overview of what to expect jumping into that career path. I'd primarily recommend it for engineering professionals considering a move into management/leadership, but I think it's a good book for anyone involved in software engineering (engineer, product, design, etc.) to read to understand the systems at play in software organizations.
